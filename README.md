# Heebolang

I created my own esoteric programming language and it's pretty ass

# How to Install and Use Heebolang

Simply clone this git and run the .exe file. If you want to make additions to it or look at how it works, I've included the .cpp source code in the respective folder. I've commented it best I can, it's a pretty self explainitory program and isn't too many lines long.

On how it works, take a look at the wiki at esolangs.org: https://esolangs.org/wiki/Heebolang
